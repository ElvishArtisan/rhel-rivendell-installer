This repo contains Rivendell installer systems for RedHat-ish distros.
Actual installers live in branches with names of the form:

<codename>_<version>

where:
  <distro-name> - The base name of the distro --i.e. 'rhel' or 'fedora'.
                  This value can typically be found in the
	          'ID' or 'ID_LIKE' fields of '/etc/os-release'.
		  NOTE: The name 'rhel' includes 'clone' versions of
                  RedHat Enterprise Linux, such as CentOS or AlmaLinux.

   <version> - The major version number --i.e. '7', '8', etc. This value
               can be found in the 'VERSION_ID' field of '/etc/os-release'.

The default 'master' branch contains nothing execept this README file.
