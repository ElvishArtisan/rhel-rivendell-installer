The files in this directory should be symlinked in the top directory of the
yum repo file heirarchy, as follows:

Makefile.repo => 9rd4/Makefile

install_rivendell_devel.sh => 9rd4/install_rivendell_devel.sh

install_rivendell.sh => 9rd4/install_rivendell.sh

sanity_check.sh => 9rd4/sanity_check.sh

'sanity_check.sh' should return 0 if the environment appears sane, otherwise
non-zero.
